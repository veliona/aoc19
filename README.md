# Advent of Code 2019

## About
Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## Personal goal

My main reason for participating in the Advent of Code is to practice problem solving skills by develop algorithms (in Python).
